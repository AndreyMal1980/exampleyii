Change in docs: The stylesheet is now loaded before the javascript in every demo, fixing a rare "to wide content" problem.

Change in script: Now supports different heigths of slides when scrolling vertical (autoheight), and different widths when scrolling horizontally (new feature: autowidth). (autoheight and autowidth both works when sliding horizontally or vertically.)

2.0.2
Change in script: Fixed autoheight and autoheight not working when using fade animations.

Change in script: Fixed skipping to slide when using ajax. 
Change in docs: Added a creative navigation 2 demo.

Change in docs: Added a multiple slides pr. page with continuous. 
Change in script: Fixed ajax-loaded images not getting scaled down correctly, if using slideCount. 
Change in download package: Added 29 test documents, to test all possible combinations of ajax, vertical, slideCount, fade, crossFade and continuous. They are located in the new "tests" folder.
Change in script: Fixed a problem when vertical, ajax and continuous was enabled. 
Change in script: Fixed a problem when ajax, fade (not crossfade) and continuous was enabled. The problem broke the script. 
Change in script: If there are five slides, and slideCount == 2, the script only makes numeric-buttons 1 to 4..

Change in script: Fixed that auto had a to long pause, if fade == true. 
Change in script: Fixed a potential inifinite loop when loading slides during a sliding animation across more than 10 unloaded slides. Also removed the limitation of only loading up to 10 slides when sliding across many unloaded slides. 
Change in script: Now all slides before the slide being animated to (if it's not a fade animation) is loaded before the actual animation is started. This removes a bug where the slider didn't animate to the correct slide (but got to the correct slide in 0 ms after the animation was done). 
Change in script: Fixed that an fade animation to the last slide didn't work correctly, if continuous is enabled. 
Change in script: Before, if there were five slides, and slideCount == 2, the script would only make numeric-buttons 1 to 4, even if continuous is true. Now that isn't the case if continuous is true. 
Change in docs: Added 2 new demos: Nested sliders and multiple sliders. 
Change in script: Added support for slideCount, ajax and continuous at the same time. Basicly the script just loads everything before initializing the full script. 
Change in script: Fixed an issue, where the numeric controls wouldn't be set correctly, if continuous is true and slideCount != 1.

Change in script: Fixed a bug where auto would never stop, if you were using fade. 
Change in script: Made the script work in IE6. Somewhere betwen 2.0.1 and 2.0.6 it stopped working in IE6. (See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5053031/weird-javascript-ie6-bug-it-think-it-needs-an-extra-bracket for more info on this bug).

2.0.10
Change in script: Fixed a bug that auto and fade didn't work.
Change in script: Sometimes when using slideCount > 1, the slider would sometimes slide way more than necessary. This is fixed for animations that goes just 1 slide (also when going from the first to the last slide (and the other way)). 
Change in script: Fixed a small bug that made the slider slide across way to much when sliding from slide 4 to 3 when there are 5 slides and slideCount = 2 and using vertical. (This is not related to the above change in script).
Change in script: Fixed continuous in IE6. (Bug introduced/created in 2.0.[unknown] )
Change in docs: Updated jQuery to version 1.5.1, fixing support for IE9. 

2.0.11

Change in docs/script: Made it posible to fix the "all slides are shown before the javascript kicks in" bug, by adding some CSS and a bit of javascript. Uncomment the commented CSS to apply the fix. 
Change in docs: Added a "modal" demo, demonstrating how you can link to an enlarged picture in a lightbox. 

2.0.12
Change in docs: Upgraded to jQuery version 1.5.2.
Change in script: If continuous is on ajaxLoadFunction was run 2 times, first on the normal element, then the "continuous-clone". And the content was also loaded twice. Now it's only loaded once, and after ajaxLoadFunction has run on the normal slide, it's cloned and placed as a "continuous-clone".
Change in script: IF for slideCount, ajax and continuous is used at the same time, all content is no longer loaded before init, now it loads after init (but all content is still being loaded). 
Change in script: Optimized fade & continuous. Now the "continuous-clones" aren't created if fade is on. 
Change in script: Fixed that the height wouldn't be adjusted correct on first load in some situations when using ajax. 
Change in script: The getValue method has a new value, "autoAnimation". It tells if an automatic slideshow is currently running. 
Change in docs: Added a mousePause demo, demonstrating how you can pause a slideshow on mouseover. 
Change in script: When enabeling auto, continuous is no-longer automaticly enabled. 
Change in script: You can now force the slider to move from last to first slide (and the other way) by using sudoSlider.goToSlide('next'); and sudoSlider.goToSlide('prev'); when continuous is disabled. This wasn't possible before, but is still not recommended. (I only added it because auto can use it when continuous is disabled.)
Change in script: Fixed that the slider wouldn't stay on the same slide in all situations, when inserting a new slide. (Using sudoSlider.insertSlide());
Change in script: Fixed that it was possible to insert an completely empty slide. (Using sudoSlider.insertSlide());
